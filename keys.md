Agda Mode Entry Cheatsheet
==========================
We have tried to stay as close to the on-paper notation as possible In
formalizing the metatheory of Hazelnut. Among other things, this means
using some special characters in the souce code here to match the
mathematical description in the write up of the paper.

This file describes how to use the emacs agda input mode to enter each of
those special characters, in roughly the order that they appear in
`Hazelnut.agda`.

 - "→" is `\to`
 - "⊤" is `\top`
 - "⊥" is `\bot"
 - "×" is `\times` or `\x`, and not to be confused with "x"
 - "·" is `\cdot`
 - "λ" is `\lambda`
 - "∘" is `\circ` or `\o`
 - "~̸" is `~\not`

 - "τ̇" is `\tau \^.`
 - "ė" is `e \^.`
 - "τ̂" is `\tau \^`
 - "ê" is `e \^`

 - "▹" is `\t 2`
 - "◃" is `\t 6`
 - "◆" is `\di`
