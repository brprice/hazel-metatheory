module deletability where
-- define relation on e^ e^ that says what a deletion is, prove it has forall exists


-- maybe also show the three:

-- 1) if G |- e^ => t then exists e^' st G |- e^ -- del --> e^' <= t
-- 2) (same for synthetic actions)
-- 3) (same for types)

-- does this follow from the mode check on deletion?
